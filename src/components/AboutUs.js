      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        Founded in 2025, Trippy began as a personal passion project by Mousumi
        Mondal, Srijita Das, and Satyapriya Das — travelers with a deep love for
        exploring new cultures, landscapes, and experiences. What started as a
        simple travel journal quickly grew into a vibrant community of
        like-minded adventurers seeking inspiration and honest travel insights.
        Over time, the blog has evolved into a trusted resource for travel
        guides, destination reviews, local tips, and photography from across the
        globe. From solo backpacking across Asia to luxury escapes in Europe,
        Trippy captures the essence of every journey and shares it with
        authenticity and heart.

      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        Our mission is to inspire and empower travelers to explore the world
        with curiosity, confidence, and respect. We aim to provide engaging
        stories, practical travel tips, and detailed guides that help our
        readers plan meaningful and memorable journeys—whether it’s a weekend
        getaway or a once-in-a-lifetime adventure. We believe that travel is not
        just about places, but about people, culture, and self-discovery.
      </p>

      <h1>Our Vision</h1>
      <p>
        Our vision is to become one of the leading voices in the global travel
        blogging community—encouraging sustainable, inclusive, and
        transformative travel. We envision a world where travel connects hearts,
        broadens minds, and fosters understanding across cultures. We strive to
        build a community where every traveler feels inspired, informed, and
        welcomed—no matter their background, experience, or destination.
